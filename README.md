Mardi Gras Mania!

This trivia game will test your knowledge of the history and cultural traditions of Mardi Gras with 20 multiple-choice questions, the order of which will be different each time.

*Keep on your toes!* Once you hit the start button, you will be given only 15 seconds to answer each question, and only a three-second break upon answering or running out of time before the next question begins.

Many of the questions deal with quite obscure facts (You may find yourself asking: "Doesn't the name 'Mardi Gras' come from French? What does the Russian royal family have to do with it, for Pyotr's sake???"), and they will come at you nonstop. Rest assured, however, for you can always try the quiz again by clicking the "start" button. You don't even need to refresh the page!
